There is difrence between USB and UART Protocol in terms of RDA 8809
We need to modify USB protocol so it would work with UART when Needed and usual USB as well

To read word: 0x02, len: 0x0007
Address in LE, Counter, current 0x83, CRC

Write Word: 0x82, len 0x000A, 
Address LE, WORD in LE, CRC

Write INT Reg: 0x84, len 0x0007
uint32 addres/Reg, uint8_t byte data framing/counter ?, crc

Read INT Reg: 0x04, len 0x0007
uint32, uint8_t

Does it need byte stuffing ?
5c ec
Yes it is 
ad0007ff028840a201855cec
0x13 is crc, its stuffed by, 5c ec
